# Week 6 Exercises: DevOps

# EXERCISE: CI/CD

# Create some form of basic CI/CD

# This can be for your team project or your own personal exercises

# See the coredeveloper-test CodePipeline job in AWS for an example

# You are free to NOT use AWS if you prefer. You can set up Jenkins and use
# Github if you prefer.

# The sample in AWS uses CodeCommit for hosting code, CodeBuild for building
# images and ECR for hosting images.

# You will find a sample Dockerfile and buildspec.yml file in this directory
# that you can use as a guide.
