# Week 5 Exercises: Testing and Error Handling

# EXERCISE 1: Unit Tests

# Write unit tests two of your week 3 and week 4 exercises.
# For example, write unit tests for Fizzbuzz and the bubble sort methods.
# Follow Clean Code standards and commit both your tests and the original
# code into this folder for easier testing.

# EXERCISE 2: Error Handling

# Write a script that counts the number of instances of each word in a
# text file. The program should open the file, parse it, and return a
# dictionary with each word as a key and the number of appearances as
# a value. You can use the randomtext.txt file for testing.

# Ensure your program has proper error handling. Use Clean Code as your
# guide. The program should be able to deal with the file missing, or
# the file not having text, or some other problem. Use try/catch blocks
# and feel free to break up the program into multiple smaller functions.
